# Show-Alert
This application is designed to allow bands to list concerts they are playing. It includes two full CRUD controllers, bands, and shows, which are connected through the bookings relationship. Concertgoers are able to view all the shows a band is playing. Using bootstrap with Ruby Sinatra as a DSL was tricky and therefore the styling is a work in progress. It may be necessary to return to a commit before bootstrap was bundled in the gemfile.
